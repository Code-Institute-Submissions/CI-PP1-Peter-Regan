## README Document for Code Institute Portfolio Project 1 "Sport Spotters"

## Purpose
"Sport Spotters" was constructed as a requirement for Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course. Its purpose is to show that I have achieved a basic command of HTML and CSS languages, and that I can combine the two to create a three-page static website.

In its imagined context, Sport Spotters is a service that connects people in London who are looking to take up sport at a social level with clubs or classes suited to their needs. Users are invited to fill out a sign-up form detailing their past sporting experience, availability, contact details, postcode, sport of interest, any relevant health conditions and willingness to travel. Sport Spotters would then connect them with an ideally suited sports club based on the information provided.

## Imagined User Stories Informing Purpose
This service would be primarily aimed at people who work full-time but want to be physically active, people who may have been active in sport before and want to revisit it, people who are new to London or people who simply want to try a new activity and don't know where to begin.

Working full-time in a major city is demanding and often requires spending significant amounts of time commuting. With many responsibilities  outside of work to take care of, taking the time to research where one could take up sport regularly can be difficult, even if one would really like to. In a city of London's size and population, it is also easy to be overwhelmed by too much information. These could be factors that may discourage someone from taking the leap into sport, even if they feel they may be lacking community outside of work or aren't physically active enough.

Moving to a new city is very daunting, and despite community-building being one of the most important factors in creating and maintaining wellbeing, it is something that can easily be neglected when one has to take care of a new home, new job, the new administrative responsibilities that accompany this and even simple problems like learning how to get around.

## Value Provided to Users by Sport Spotters
Sport Spotters would be a service to take care of those obstacles that prevent someone from joining a new sports club. If one is too tired or time-pressed from work, or is bamboozled by the sheer amount of choice in London, this service would remove the greater part of the mental energy, effort and research required to make a decision on where to start.

## Technologies Used
For this project I used GitHub to both host and deploy my repository. GitHub's built in code editor allowed me to make a primarily HTML site. I made an external style sheet in using CSS and linked it to the website's HTML files to style each webpage. Media queries were used in the CSS style sheet to make sure the website is responsive to differing screen sizes.

## Design

***Layout and General Structure***
To begin with, I had an initial rough mental image of how the three pages of the site would look as represented by the photos inserted here.

![Rough Layout of Home Page](https://github.com/sonetto104/CI-PP1-Peter-Regan/blob/main/Home%20Page%20Layout.jpg)
![Rough Layout of Available Sports Page](https://github.com/sonetto104/CI-PP1-Peter-Regan/blob/main/Available%20Sports%20Layout.jpg)
![Rough Layout of Sign Up Page](https://github.com/sonetto104/CI-PP1-Peter-Regan/blob/main/Sign%20Up%20Layout.jpg)

Frankly, this was not a good approach. It would have been far more efficient to use a wireframing tool like Balsamiq. This would have allowed me to build a better defined structure that would have made styling and implementing media queries much simpler and more effective later on. However, I was not aware of this at the time.

***Colour Scheme***
I used primarily navy and white for the website. This was in order to make sure elements could be easily contrasted but without making the mood of the website too severe. The site aims to make users feel positive and lighthearted about sport after all. ![Screenshot of Sport Spotters Homepage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DlNP04rmtC9IIwjLJOm0-E8oteyJq2G/view?usp=share_link)

***Fonts***
The fonts used were Lobster and Signika, both of which I took from Google Fonts. I used Lobster for the logo and headings as I wanted a font that felt lighthearted and friendly without seeming childish. Signika was a more appropriate neutral font for the rest of the text elements to make them easily legible.

***Grid and Flex Layouts***
I used grid and flex layouts to arrange images and text in a way that adds visual variety to the site while maintaining balance between visual elements. These layouts are also responsive to screen size. I've attached screenshots of some of these layouts below so you can see how they change depending on screen size.

***Images***
All the images for this project were taken from www.pexels.com. Using one source for images allowed me to choose images that were consistent in tone. It was important to me that images conveyed a sense of enjoyment in sport, and that they looked like they could at least potentially have been taken in London where Sports Spotters would be based.
