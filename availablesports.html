            <div class="available-sport-text"><h2>Circuit Training</h2><p>If burning calories, breaking a sweat and getting your heart pumping is the goal, circuit training is for you.

            <div class="available-sport-text"><h2>Rowing</h2><p>A very high-intensity sport, rowing requires both strength and fine skill, as well as the mental endurance to push on even when your body wants to give up.

            <div class="available-sport-text"><h2>Touch Rugby</h2><p>Touch rugby is perfect for anyone who loves the excitement of the slow-build in rugby, but doesn't want to worry about concussion or broken bones in the process! Touch rugby tends to be very social in London - a Saturday morning game is often followed by a trip to the pub!</p></div><div class="available-sport-image"><img class="sport-div-img" src="./assets/gallery/touch rugby.jpg" alt="A group of people playing rugby."></div> 
            <div class="available-sport-text"><h2>Running</h2><p>Perhaps the simplest of all options available - nothing required other than some shoes on your feet!
